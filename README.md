# Mapillary Random Image Generation Site
## Overview
NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY REQUIRES MANUAL DOWNLOADING + SETUP TO WORK.

This repo contains two main features:
1. A python flask server (app.py) that generates you a random image from Mapillary based on the bounding box you draw.
2. A python script (random_image.py) that prints the image id and coordinates of a random image based off a bounding box defined in the script.

Both scripts (and various other files relating to the scripts) need setting up in order to work. Details for each part are given below.
